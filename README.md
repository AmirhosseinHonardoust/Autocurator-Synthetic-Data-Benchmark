# Autocurator: Synthetic Data Benchmark Evaluator

## Overview
**Autocurator** is a modular evaluation toolkit that benchmarks **synthetic vs. real tabular data**.  
It computes quantitative metrics for *fidelity*, *coverage*, *privacy*, and *utility*, then visualizes results through a detailed HTML report and publication-ready figures.

This benchmark analyzes a small dataset of customer attributes (`age`, `income`, `score`, `visits`, `target`) to assess how closely synthetic samples resemble real data.

## Evaluation Summary

| Category | Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|:--|:--|:--:|:--|
| **Fidelity** | Mean JSD | 0.475 | Moderate divergence between histograms |
|  | Mean KS | 0.12 | Slight difference in cumulative distributions |
|  | Mean Wasserstein | 290.8 | Variation in scale between features |
|  | Correlation Distance | 0.0065 | Very high structure preservation |
| **Coverage** | Precision | 1.0 | Synthetic points inside a real neighborhood |
|  | Recall | 1.0 | Real points inside a synthetic neighborhood |
|  | Density | 1.16 | Avg. real neighborhoods each synthetic point falls in (÷k) |
|  | Coverage | 1.0 | Real points with a synthetic neighbor nearby |
| **Privacy** | Mean NN Distance | 0.29 | Average synthetic-to-real nearest-neighbor distance |
|  | Min NN Distance | 0.11 | Closest any synthetic point sits to a real point |
|  | MIA AUC | 0.04 | Far from 0.5 → real and synthetic are distinguishable; below 0.5 signals memorization (see note) |
| **Utility** | TSTR AUC | 1.0 | Synthetic training transfers to real |
|  | TRTS AUC | 1.0 | Real training transfers to synthetic |

> **Note on the bundled example.** The toy `synthetic.csv` is a lightly perturbed copy of `real.csv`. The corrected membership-inference metric (AUC ≈ 0.0) correctly flags this near-duplication as a privacy risk, and the perfect utility scores reflect that the two sets are almost identical. Treat it as a wiring example, not as a model of good synthetic data.

## Metric Definitions

### **Fidelity**
Measures how close synthetic data is to real data.
- **Jensen Shannon Divergence (JSD):** Overlap between distributions, lower is better.
- **Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS):** Difference in cumulative distributions.
- **Wasserstein Distance:** "Effort" needed to transform one distribution into another.
- **Correlation Distance:** Difference between correlation matrices of real and synthetic data.

### **Coverage**
PRDC metrics (Naeem et al., 2020) using per-point k-nearest-neighbor hyperspheres.
- **Precision:** Fraction of synthetic points inside a real hypersphere.
- **Recall:** Fraction of real points inside a synthetic hypersphere.
- **Density:** Average number of real hyperspheres each synthetic point falls into, normalized by `k` (robust to outliers).
- **Coverage:** Fraction of real points with at least one synthetic point nearby.

### **Privacy**
Quantifies distance and distinguishability.
- **Nearest Neighbor Distance:** Larger synthetic-to-real distances indicate less overlap.
- **Membership Inference Attack (MIA):** Distance-based re-identification proxy. An AUC near **0.5** means real and synthetic are indistinguishable by nearest-neighbor distance (low risk). Values far from 0.5 mean they are distinguishable; **below 0.5** indicates synthetic points sit unusually close to real ones (possible memorization / higher risk). Real points are compared against their nearest *other* real point so self-matches don't make the attack trivially perfect.
- **Holdout MIA (optional):** If you pass `--holdout` a disjoint real set the generator never saw, `mia_auc_holdout` runs the stronger distance-to-closest-record attack: members vs. non-members scored by proximity to synthetic. **0.5 = no leakage**; above 0.5 means training records are closer to synthetic than holdout records.

### **Utility**
Assesses whether synthetic data supports the same predictions.
- **TSTR:** Train on synthetic, test on real.
- **TRTS:** Train on real, test on synthetic.

## Figures and Analysis

### PCA Projection
PCA projection shows global similarity, blue (real) and orange (synthetic) points overlap strongly.

---

### Feature Distributions
Histograms show per-feature alignment. Minor scale variance indicates good distribution diversity.

---

### Correlation Heatmaps
Correlation matrices of real and synthetic datasets are almost identical, confirming strong structural fidelity.

## How to Run

### Step 1, Install
The package uses a `src/` layout, so install it (editable) to put `autocurator`
on your path. This also pulls in the dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
```bash
pip install -e .
```
Add the tooling used by CI with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`.

### Step 2, Run Benchmark
```bash
autocurator \
  --real data/real.csv \
  --synthetic data/synthetic.csv \
  --target target \
  --task classification \
  --out_dir outputs/runs/example_run \
  --report reports/example_run.html
```
`python -m autocurator.cli ...` works too once the package is installed.

**Optional flags**

- `--k N` — neighborhood size for the PRDC coverage metrics (default 5).
- `--utility_model {linear,rf}` — utility estimator: linear baseline (default) or
  a random forest that captures non-linear structure.
- `--holdout path.csv` — a disjoint real set the generator never saw; enables the
  stronger holdout-based membership-inference attack (`mia_auc_holdout`).

**Config file.** Any option can be set in a YAML config; CLI arguments override it.
```bash
autocurator --config configs/example.yaml
```

### Step 3, View Results
Open `reports/example_run.html` in a browser (image links resolve relative to the
report's location, so the report and its `--out_dir` plots can live in different folders).

## Use Cases

1. **Synthetic Data Validation**, verify realism and structure before model training.  
2. **Data Sharing Compliance**, ensure privacy before external release.  
3. **AI Governance Audits**, demonstrate data safety quantitatively.  
4. **Academic Research**, evaluate synthetic generators (VAE, GAN, Copula, Diffusion).  
5. **Pipeline QA**, assess model robustness using synthetic inputs.

## Future Enhancements

- Add **CTGAN** and **Diffusion** benchmark support.  
- Implement **multivariate Wasserstein** and Earth Mover’s Distance.  
- Integrate **differential privacy accounting** for stronger guarantees.  
- Develop a **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time visual inspection.  
- Extend to **mixed categorical embeddings** for complex datasets.
